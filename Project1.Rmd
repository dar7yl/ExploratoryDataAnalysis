 Git fork: <https://github.com/dar7yl/ExData_Plotting1>

 Data source: <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption#>
 
```{r}
file.info("exdata_data_household_power_consumption.zip")
```


```{r}

summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
